Each question is implemented in a separate class

All classes are organized under the same namespace

The solution is configured for Debug and Release modes

🧠 Concepts Covered

The assignment focuses on strengthening the following skills:

Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

Loop structures (for)

Conditional logic (if, else)

Boolean logic

Console input/output

Clean and readable C# code

🧪 Sample Solved Questions
🔹 Question 1: Sum of Even Numbers from 1 to 100

Calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

Logic Used:

Loop starts from 2 and increments by 2

Each even number is added to a total variable

The final result is printed to the console

Sample Output:

Sum of even numbers from 1 to 100: 2550

🔹 Question 2: Prime Number Check

Checks whether a given number is a prime number.

Logic Used:

Tests divisibility from 2 up to half of the number

Uses a boolean flag to determine the result

Sample Output:

Prime number


or

Not prime
